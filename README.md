# HawkEye
Interactive map for tracking door2door sales pitches around London for a product launch. 

The problem:
The task at my job is to carry out "walk-ins" in areas of London. A walk-in is when you walk into a business and pitch our product. The issue is that there is more than one person doing this and each needs to know where the other has been. Moreover, each salesperson needs to retain critical information about when the decision maker will be at the premises and further information from the interaction. 

Therefore, having a map on which a coloured pin coloured according to different categories of result and a timer would be a help, minimising the cognitive and adminsitrative load of the job.
